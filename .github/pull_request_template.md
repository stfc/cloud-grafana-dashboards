### Description:

<!--
This should be a brief description of the PR. Details should be contained in commit messages

The PR should be restricted to only two or three changes. For adding new dashboards this should be done over more than one PR due to the size of the JSON files for dashboards.

Examples of summary of changes:
- Which dashboards were updated
- If new dashboards were created, a summary of what the dashboards will show
